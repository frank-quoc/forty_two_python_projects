# 11. YouTube Video Downloader

## Project

One of the best ideas to start experimenting with you hands-on python projects for students is working on a YouTube video downloader. More than a billion people watch YouTube every month. Sometimes there are videos we like to download permanently. YouTube doesnâ€™t give you that option, but you can create an app with a simple UI and the ability to download YouTube videos in different formats and video quality. This project looks tough, but it is straightforward when you start working on it.
